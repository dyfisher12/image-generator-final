## Description
This program will asks the user to select between several options for a background, characters, and a pet that is displayed in an image. The user can also select to have a randomly generated quote display on the screen. Honestly, I did not get to finish this project. I started late and had too many bugs to work through. Next time I would give myself more time to work on these issues. I included different files that contain each of the images that are available as options to choose during the program. I also included a txt file of different quotes to choose from.
