# Image Generator

## Repository
https://github.com/dyfisher12/image-generator-final.git

## Description
This program will ask the user multiple questions about the background and characters they would like to have in the image. I would also like to add some music to go along with the custom image that the user creates.

## Features
Random Selection Option - If the user does not want to pick any specific background, character, or sound, they can choose to select 'random' for each category. This will create a unique image using the randrange or randchoice functions.
Sound - I want to add the option to have sound or music with the generated image, like a rain storm or some elevator music. I will have to research further how to do this.
User Text Input - I would like to add a feature where the user can make a title, caption, or speech bubble to one of the characters, maybe with a custom selected color or font, and a random function to choose from a list of created quotes.

## Challenges
I will have to research how to implement sound in my final window for the generated image.
I will have to make sure that the random choice function does not select duplicates for the characters.
I had trouble with the draw and font functions in the previous labs, so I will have to look more into this for my program.

## Ideal Outcome
The ideal outcome for this code is an image with a clear background, proper resolution, with 2 to 3 characters, sound, and text that was input by the user.

The minimum viable outcome is at least an image with a background and two characters selected on the screen, and some text displaying on the screen that was not decided by the user, but is implemented into the code itself.

## Milestones

Week 1 - 
  Goal 1 - Create the necessary functions for my code - bare bones for creating an image and getting user input
  Goal 2 - Do research on how to implement sound into my program

Week 2 -
  Goal 1 - Finish up the image generation portion of my code
  Goal 2 - Start implementing the sound and text part of the image generator

Week 3 -
  Goal 1 - Have the code mostly done, making small tweaks to features as needed
  Goal 2 - Have a completed, working program ready to submit
